### Application Concept
<p>
Our application is centered around viewing and creating collaborative art. Users should be able to open the application and find pinned art locations near them. An art location is either a landmark (local mural, temporary installation, etc.) found by another user or a collaborative arts event open for anyone to join (figure drawing, sketch groups, etc). Users should be able to review art locations on a map and submit their own.
